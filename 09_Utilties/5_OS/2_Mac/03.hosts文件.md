The reason is that Apple has apparently decided you must put your own entries at the top. So you must do this instead:192.168.1.15 balabala.com

##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting. Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1 localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1 localhost
```
